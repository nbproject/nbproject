Installation Procedure: 

1-Dependencies: 
On a typical debian-like (ubuntu etc...) distribution, NB requires the following packages: (note that packages in square brackets are optional)
   * python (>= 2.6)
   * postgresql (>= 8.4)
   * imagemagick
   * [pdfedit]
   * [unison]
   * postgresql-plpython-8.4
   * python-pypdf
   * mupdf-tools (for pdfdraw)
   * context (for rich, i.e. annotated pdf generation)

To make sure you have these installed, you can run the following command: 
sudo make prereqs_common

Then, NB can be deplyed as a django app, which requires the following: 
- For the apache django version: 
    * apache (>= 2)
    * python-psycopg2 
    * django (>=1.3.1).  
    * libapache2-mod-wsgi
    To make sure you have these installed, you can run the following command: 
    sudo make prereqs_django

    * python-openid (>= 2.2.0)
    * python-django-openid-auth (for OpenId authentication) 
       Note about django_openid_auth: We've tested w/ the version downloadable from launchpad.net (0.4), not w/ the ubuntu package:
       - Download the tarball from https://launchpad.net/django-openid-auth
       - Untar and sudo python setup.py install
    * django_facebook_oath, for example from this github fork: https://github.com/sachazyto/django_facebook_oauth
      - download the zip and unzip
      - sudo python setup.py install


-> make django 
-> edit values in apps/settings_credentials.py
-> sudo make create_dirs   #create root folder and some folders below that for nb data
-> make django       #make Apache aware of Django framework
-> make apidev          #Since there is alot of js, this improves performance 
-> edit params in content/ui/classic/conf.js: Tell which server(s) the client should use to fetch various pieces data

2- Database Initialization: 
   * Log in as someone who has postgres create role and create database privileges, such as postgres (one way is to do 'su' and then 'su postgres')
   * createuser nbadmin -P #important to setup as superuser since only superusers can create a language (used for plpythonu) 
   * Back to the regular user: 
   * 	  createdb -U nbadmin -h localhost notabene
   *	  cd apps
   *	  ./manage.py syncdb   #to actually create the tables. 
   * You may also have to allow remote connections
     * sudo nano /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf 
          o host    notabene       nbadmin       127.0.0.1/0     password
     * sudo nano /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/
   * if you make a mistake:
          o dropdb  -U nbadmin -h localhost notabene
          o createdb -U nbadmin -h localhost notabene
... at this point you can try your installation using the Django debug server (but never use this in production...): 
    from the apps directory:  ./manage.py runserver
    in your browser: http//localhost:8000

3- Extra stuff
   - To be able to genereate annotated pdfs: Configure tex so that it allows mpost commands: make sure that 'mpost' is in shell_escape_commands (cf /tex/texmf/texmg.cnf) 

4- Crontab setup
   A sample crontab as part of the 'make django'. You just need to add it to your crontab for it to take effect

5- Backup 
   - Database:  use the pg_dump command, for instance, if NB was installed on host nb.csail.mit.edu, that the DB belonged to postgres used nbadmin, and that the DB was called notabene, you'd use the following: 
     -pg_dump -U nbadmin -h nb.csail.mit.edu -Fc notabene > nb.backup.YYYYMMDD
   - uploaded PDF files: Use your favorite file backup technique (tar, rdiff-backup, unison etc...) to backup the directory: 
     "%s%s" % (settings.HTTPD_MEDIA,settings.REPOSITORY_DIR) (cf your settings.py files for actual values). 

6- Notes: 
    Note that at the time of this writing, ubuntu 10.04 and Debian 5.0.7 still hasn't the Django 1.3.1 version so it can be installed from the the Django website
