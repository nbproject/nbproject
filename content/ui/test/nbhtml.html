                        <p>
                            <b>Copyright</b> is a legal concept that grants authors and artists control over certain uses of their creations for defined periods of time. It limits who may copy, change, perform, or share those creations. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As we saw in the Introduction, there are several views concerning the purposes of copyright law. One view is that copyright law encourages creativity by allowing creators to profit from their work. This goal of copyright is reflected in the wording of many copyright laws.  For example, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause">"Copyright Clause"</a> of the United States Constitution states that Congress may grant authors copyright protection for their works for a limited time in order to "promote the progress of science and useful arts." (US Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8.)  Similarly, the stated purpose of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne">Statute of Anne</a>, the first copyright statute in England, was to "encourage learning."  (8 Anne Chapter 19 (1710).)  Another view is that copyright law ensures that authors are paid fairly for their effort. A third view is that a creative work is an expression of the personality of its creator, and thus should be protected from being used without the creator's permission. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although copyright law grants authors many rights in their works, it also limits these rights in many important ways. Most of these limitations are quite specific, but a few are broad.  Several, as we will see, enable librarians to use or disseminate copyrighted materials more freely than they otherwise could.
                        </p>
                        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_Is_The_Public_Domain.3F">What Is The Public Domain? </span></h2>
                        <p>
                            The <b>public domain</b> is the name given to the set of creative works that are not protected by copyright law -- either because they are no longer covered by the limited terms of copyright law, because their creators did not comply with various formal requirements in the past, or because their creators deliberately donated to the public the rights that they might have asserted. As an illustration, suppose the fictional country of Booktonia has a copyright term of 20 years. If a book was written in 1980, the copyright protection for the book in Booktonia would have ended 20 years later, in 2000.  Once the copyright in a work expires, the work is said to "fall into" the public domain. Once a work is in the public domain, the restrictions of copyright law no longer apply, and anyone may copy, reuse, or share the work as they wish. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The public domain functions as a pool of creative material from which anyone may draw. It provides authors the raw materials from which the next generation of books, movies, songs, and knowledge can be built.  As the 14th century English poet Chaucer (whose work is now in the public domain) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/English/Fowls.htm">wrote</a>, "For out of the old fields, as men say, Comes all this new corn, from year to year; And out of old books, in good faith, Comes all this new science that men learn."
                        </p>
                        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Who_Makes_Copyright_Law.3F">Who Makes Copyright Law? </span></h2>
                        <p>
                            Several <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_2:_The_International_Framework">international treaties</a> set standards that all participating countries must follow when adopting or changing their copyright laws. However, within those limits, each nation sets its own laws. Those laws determine who can acquire a copyright, what rights the copyright holder enjoys, and how long the copyright lasts. As a result, copyright law varies significantly from one country to another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In all countries, copyright law is shaped in part by legislatures, which adopt and often modify copyright statutes, and courts, which adjust and clarify the provisions of the statutes when applying them to particular cases.  In so-called <b>common law</b> countries, courts play somewhat more important roles than they do in so-called <b>civil law</b> countries, but the difference is not large. In some countries, <b>religious legal systems</b> also affect copyright rules. A discussion of the three main types of legal system, as well as lists of the legal systems of different countries may be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_systems_of_the_world">here</a>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No matter what the legal system, however, copyright law is constantly chanigng to meet new creative, technological, and social challenges. Often those changes are driven by interest groups that seek to benefit their members. The library community has often played important roles in the shaping of copyright law in the past -- and could play even more important roles in the future.

                        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_Does_Copyright_Law_Cover.3F">What Does Copyright Law Cover? </span></h2>
                        <p>
                            Copyright law generally covers all “original works of authorship.”  Such original works come in many forms.  For example, in almost all countries, all of the following are protected by copyright law:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>literary works (books, articles, letters, etc.);
                            </li>
                            <li>musical works;
                            </li>
                            <li>dramatic works (operas, plays);
                            </li>
                            <li>graphic arts (photographs, sculptures, paintings, etc.);
                            </li>
                            <li>motion pictures and audiovisual works (movies, videos, television programs, etc.);
                            </li>
                            <li>architectural works; and
                            </li>
                            <li>computer software.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In some countries, sound recordings are also covered by copyright law. In other countries, sound recordings are protected by a separate, related set of rules known as “neighboring rights.”  In some countries, government works -- such as maps, official reports, and judicial opinions -- are protected by copyright law; in others, they are considered part of the public domain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important to remember that <b>copyright never applies to ideas or facts.</b>  It only covers <b>“original expression”</b> -- in other words, the distinctive way in which ideas are conveyed.  So, for example, the information contained in a science textbook is not protected by copyright law. You are free, after reading a textbook, to write and publish a new book conveying the same information in different words. Similarly, you are free, after reading a work of history, to write a novel incorporating the historical facts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few countries (most notably, the United States) require the original expression to be fixed in a <b>tangible medium</b>, like paper or a digital recording format, in order to be protected by copyright law.  In those countries, improvisational performances -- for example, of jazz or dance -- are not protected unless their authors record them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Copyright law covers works that have not been published or even made public. So, for example, private letters, diaries, and email messages are all protected by copyright law.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some countries used to require published works to be registered with a central office or to carry a copyright notice with the name of the author and the year of publication in order to be protected by copyright law.  Such <b>formalities</b> are no longer necessary for a work to be covered by copyright law.  However, registering a copyright may help prove authorship or identify who must be contacted for permission before a work can be reused.  In some countries, registration of a work is necessary before the author is permitted to sue someone for copyright infringement.  (Foreign authors, however, are exempted from this requirement.)  In addition, some countries continue to require publishers to deposit one copy of every new work in a designated office, such as a national library.
                        </p>
                        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Who_Gets_A_Copyright.3F">Who Gets A Copyright? </span></h2>
                        <p>
                            A copyright is ordinarily obtained by the creator of a work.  If you write a novel, paint a painting, or compose a song, you will generally acquire the copyright in your creation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The situation is more complicated if you are an employee creating the work as part of your employment. Countries vary a great deal in how they deal with such situations. Typically, in countries that follow the common law tradition, the copyright in a work prepared by an employee within the scope of employment goes to the employer. By contrast, in countries that follow the civil law tradition, the copyright typically goes to the employee. However, in civil-law countries, employment contracts or even copyright law often give employers rights over their employees’ creations similar (though not identical) to the copyrights enjoyed by employers in common-law countries.  Finally, in the United States and some other countries, when specific types of works are created in specific circumstances by independent contractors, the contractors and the organizations commissioning the works may agree in writing that the commissioning organizations shall be awarded the copyrights.
                        </p>
                        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_Rights_Come_With_Copyright.3F">What Rights Come With Copyright? </span></h2>
                        <p>
                            The rights created by copyright law fall into two categories:  economic rights and moral rights.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Economic rights</b> are intended to give authors the opportunity to use their works to make money. These are things that typically only the owner of the copyright may do unless the owner grants permission to others. (Important exceptions to the requirement to obtain the copyright holder's permission, such as fair use and compulsory licenses, are discussed below.)  The primary economic rights are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the right to reproduce the work -- in other words, to make copies of it;
                            </li>
                            <li>the right to create derivative works -- such as translations, abridgments, or adaptations;
                            </li>
                            <li>the right to distribute the work -- for example, by selling or renting copies of it;
                            </li>
                            <li>the right to perform or display the work publicly.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            <b>Moral rights</b> are designed to protect authors’ noneconomic interests in their creations. Moral rights do not exist in all countries.  Generally speaking, they are recognized more widely and are enforced more firmly in civil-law countries than in common-law countries.  The primary moral rights are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the right of integrity -- for example, the right to prevent the destruction or defacement of a painting or sculpture;
                            </li>
                            <li>the right of attribution -- in other words, the right to be given appropriate credit for one’s creations, and not to be blamed for things one did not create;
                            </li>
                            <li>the right of disclosure -- the right to determine when and if a work shall be made public;
                            </li>
                            <li>the right of withdrawal -- the right (in certain limited circumstances) to remove from public circulation copies of a work one has come to regret.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            <b>Neighboring rights</b>, sometimes called related rights, are close cousins of copyright. The oldest and best known neighboring rights are economic rights granted to persons who are not authors of a work but who contribute to its creation -- such as performers, producers, and broadcasting associations. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some countries also have privacy and publicity rights that complement copyright. For example, some countries prevent the public distribution of works that contain personally identifiable information, unless permission is granted by that person.
